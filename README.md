## 📌 Project Overview
Rice grain classification is an essential task in the agricultural industry for quality control and grading. This project implements a **machine learning-based classification model** that categorizes different types of rice grains based on their physical characteristics.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing and Cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Feature Engineering  
✅ Model Training (ML Algorithms)  
✅ Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics  
✅ Deployment Ready Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of rice grains, such as:
- **Length**
- **Width**
- **Shape Factor**
- **Perimeter**
- **Compactness**
- **Kernel Aspect Ratio**
